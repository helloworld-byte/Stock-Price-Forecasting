# Attention-based CNN-LSTM and XGBoost hybrid model for stock prediction

# To use:

Firstly, run `ARIMA.py` for pre-processing step by ARIMA model. Then, run the neural network or XGBoost models.
- Run `LSTM.py` for the single-layer LSTM, multi-layer LSTM, and bidirectional LSTM models.
- Run `XGBoost.py` for the XGBoost model.
- Run `Main.py` for our proposed Attention-based CNN-LSTM and XGBoost hybrid model.
